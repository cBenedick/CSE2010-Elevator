The main issue is that we need to make a main() for MultiplePeople.java.

All the other classes are fine; MultiplePeople.java will implement Elevator.java which implements.... everything else.

Make sure to click the Branch Option when saving a new copy to Github!

Standard Case (Work on this first!) :
  Elevator goes to 1, then goes to the top, dropping off and picking up people as they go.
  Then the elevator goes back to 1, dropping off and picking up people as they go

Time Range = 8am - 8pm
100 People
15 floors

  - Lunch Break
  - 2 Elevators
